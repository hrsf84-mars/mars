# Project Roadmap

Our plan is to divide up our project into four sprints -- two while we can work together in person and two that will be done remotely.  Our milestones are set up to show iterative progress, though we'll remain flexible as new information comes up.

Sprint 1:
  - Get API data from omdb, google, twitter, others

Sprint 2:
  - Put API data in database for our use
  - Display API data to users of our website

Sprint 3:
  - Add advanced displays of data (charts, tables, interactive?) 
  - Compare movies to other movies

Sprint 4 (stretch goals):
  - Aggregate data across categories (genre, year, country)
  - Perform analytics on the data (projections and predictions)
